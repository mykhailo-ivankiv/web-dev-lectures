            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This document serves as a reference for the HTML syntax, vocabulary and its associated DOM APIs and is intended for web site and application developers, publishers, tutorial writers and teachers and their students. That is, people who write documents using HTML, or who teach others to do so.</p>
            <p>This guide is structured into three major sections. The first provides a set of basic templates for authors to get started with.</p>
            <p>The second section provides an in depth look at the syntax of HTML and XHTML documents. This will investigate both the similarities and differences between the two alternatives and provides guidance on choosing which to use for your own projects, depending on your needs. Additionally, this will also provide details about creating polyglot documents — that is, documents that conform to both HTML and XHTML simultaneiously — including issues related to ensuring stylesheets and scripts work correctly under both conditions.</p>
            <p>The third and final section provides a reference for the HTML vocabulary. Each element is described, providing details about its its meaning, allowed attributes, content models and DOM APIs. Each is accompanied by clear examples illustrating how the element is designed to be used for a range of different use cases.</p>
